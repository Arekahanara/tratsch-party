# Tratsch-Party

Tratsch-Party is one of my community projects, which is still work in progress. It includes a classic endless login, media upload, newsfeed and more to create a platform where several users can easily exchange ideas with each other.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install # Or yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm start
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, checkout the [Nuxt.js docs](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.js).

## Backpack

We use [backpack](https://github.com/palmerhq/backpack) to watch and build the application, so you can use the latest ES6 features (module syntax, async/await, etc.).
